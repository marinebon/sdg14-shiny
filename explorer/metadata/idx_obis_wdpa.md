The protection metric is the ratio of average extinction risk for species observed inside versus outside marine protected areas. The observations by country are derived from the occurrence records in the [Ocean Biogeographic Information System](http://iobis.org) (**OBIS**) and intersected with the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) from [**MarineRegions.org**](http://marineregions.org). OBIS also provides the **IUCN** [RedList](http://www.iucnredlist.org) extinction risk status through the `robis::checklist` function. And the marine protected areas come from the [World Database of Protected Areas](https://www.protectedplanet.net/) (**WDPA**).
