The chlorophyll _a_ (chl) data come from the **MODIS Aqua** satellite sensor, September 2002-present. The Level-3 mapped 9-km monthly products were obtained directly from [**NASA** Ocean Color](https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/) and processed by Dan Otis at USF IMARS. Products are in geographic project at nominally 9km at the equator (4320x2160 columnsxrows).
